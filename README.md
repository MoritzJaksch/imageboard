# Imageboard

This is a single page application I created to learn vue.js. It allows you to upload, comment and like pictures and organize them by tags you give them during the uploading process.

## Built With

- [vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/) - the front-end framework used
- [express.js](http://expressjs.com/de/api.html) - the node.js framework used
- [AWS S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/index.html#lang/en_us) - storage and hosting for images
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/index.html) - for database management

## Project Overview

#### <u>Uploader</u>

When you enter the page, the first thing you see is the title and the uploader interface. You can enter a name for the picture you are about to upload, as well as a short description, your username and a range of tags you would like to give your picture to make it easier to find for other users.
